## Introduction:
Congratulations on receiving your space vessel piloting license! 

The galaxy is a vast place, full of mysteries, and we need your help to better understand it.

You will need to mine resources, research stars and planets, and outfit your ship to get the job done!

This is a 4x genre inspired adventure, reduced down to a 13 kilobyte 2D game.

## Controls: 
Everything is controlled via touch or mouse.

## Tips for playing:
Your starting vessel will determine whether you start with Scanners, Mining Lasers, or Weapons installed. All systems can be installed and upgraded regardless of this choice.
  - The coil subscriber ship (Abandoned Imperial Cruiser) provides the easiest start.
  - The mining ship (Rusted Mining Vessel) would be a close second.
  - The research ship (Old Research Vessel) is not much tougher than the mining ship to get started.
  - The combat ship (Retired Combat Vessel) is the hardest start by far, and not recommended for new players.

From the star chart, select a destination star system, and depart to start manually piloting a flight there. 
  - Start with nearby stars, travel time with a level 1 engine can take a while.
  
While en route to your destination you can fight space pirates, mine from planets and asteroids, and research planets and stars.
  - Research data will only be collected if the scanners are installed and powered.
  - Raw Materials will only be mined if the Mining Lasers (M.Lasers) are installed and powered.

Your ship can be repaired and upgraded from any station.
  - If your destination has other star systems along the way you will have the chance to temporarily stop in to use the hanger.

Make use of Jump Gates to save time traversing the galaxy.
  - Credits are a resource meant to be used, don't feel the need to manually pilot between every system if you are flush with credits.
