## Rendering event deck on screen
- Similar to tilemap / region rendering
- Player has 1 dimension, we check +- from the player position and render the objects accordingly (1 unit == 1 pixel
- Maybe I do want some sort of ndoe to handle this... nomrally I would just fresh render the sprite in place, but in this case I need to render the right node at the right location.
- Sometimes its a sprite, sometimes its a "ship" node)
- Do I really want a node with up to 50 children nodes?
  - Really I only need like... 5 or 6 nodes total... maybe more since I will want a pool of sprites and a pool of "ships"
  - Maybe the particle should be its own node?
  - It would be nice to just have a small rotating pool of 'encounter nodes' that I could update the TAG for and have it render the right thing...
  - Have an array of the nodes, pop one, retag it and once its out of range, put it back in the pool
  - need to be able to toggle:
    - particles
    - bobble
  - or... each frame I retag as many objects as I need, tag the rest as "none"
  - do I use native rendering code, or just toggle a sprite's visibile and change its sprite value?
