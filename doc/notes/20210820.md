## HUD
- Shows the objects within range of the player's scanners
- Need to be able to show up to 2... maybe 3 things at a time?
- Will show HP bar if they have one, and will list other propertlys of the encounter + a Name
- Should I generate names for the stars and planets?
  - ie DB 123123, DB 123123 B, DB 123123 b, DB 123123 c
- Names for bodies would be like DB 123123 B (Star), DB 123123 c (Gas Planet)

- what is in range? 
  - for player: something in the range with size of position => position + scale * 16
