# 2021-08-14 - Day 2

## Timeline Stuff
- Can fit 20 32px cards on the screen
- Closest cards can be is side by side
- Card is active as soon as its first pixel is in the window of oppertunity
- Engine speed controls scroll speed (1 pixel every ____ ms?)
- Should figure out what 1 pixel represents, 1 pixel per ms / # pixels/distance per sec
- How quickly on the wall clock do I want a card to take from appearing on screen to leaving?
- Early levels I don't want overlap (or at least much)
- So window of oppertunity needs to be long enough to benefit player, but prevent crazy overlap
- Maybe scanners CAN impact the size?
  - 1 => 4
  - Base size is maybe 3 cards wide? Each powered level is 16 pixels more, divided in half?
    - 96 => 112 => 128 => 144 => 160
- How to balance combat?
  - Pirates have a red window to show their range maybe?
