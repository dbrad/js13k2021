- Starmap system?
  - instead of contract, generate a small star field
  - player can go from any point to another
  - length of the trip is based on distance of points
  - either divide the area into 3 for low, medium and high threat
    - or have this be controlled by distance to the center (radiuseses)
  - resource generation is 3 points placed on map, distance to that point controls scarcity?
  - can by cheap at high volume, sell high at low / no volume?
  - generate contracts on certain points? (goto point with x resource?)
    - celestite, solarium, astrotanium?
  - q drive makes a new map? but with the higher generator level
  - at level 5 the map will have the high threat final system with the anomaly

  Algorithm?
  - place a point in the centerish
  - try to add a point
    - how to best check not points are within a minium radius?
    - need spacial storage?
