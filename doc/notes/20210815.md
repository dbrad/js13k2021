- Let's hook up the segment controls to the gamestate!
- Plus and minus buttons need to increase and decrease the current power level, up to the max, if power is available
- Power bank needs to update with gamestate values


- Player's current distance number is always going up.
- All event / objects are at a certain distance #
- Events within X range of the player's current position are shown on screen
  - Events within Y range are within the player's "window of opertunity"

There are about 320ish pixels ahead of the player
Base speed an object should take...5 seconds to get to the player?
I want event to move at like 1 pixel per 16 ms?

~7500 distnace short run, ~2 - 4 minutes for a run?
default speed is 1 pixel / distance per 32ms
32, 28, 24, 20, 16

window to render is ~ player "position" +- 480
deck will be sorted, delete events we have passed, will only need to check from index 0 until we are past the window

## Deck generation
shuffle the required node / node counts into the deck
assign a random distance number?
end on a station

don't use the first 500 units? start player at -480? same same?
