- star speeds
- we have 4 levels of z
  - 1, 2, 3, 4
  - before we were doing -4 * (z/8) per frame
    - this would give us pixel per frame values of:
      - 1 = -0.5
      - 2 = -1
      - 3 = -1.5
      - 4 = -2

    - lower z = further away
    - I want the foreground to be fast than the stars
    - we have 5 total speeds, default + 4 levels of engine, each engine level should be about 25% faster
    - I previously said I wanted 1 pixel per ~32ms at default, down to 1 per ~16ms
    - meaning backgrounds needs to move at like 64,128,256,512 at default
    - so I want the z levels to work as
    - 1 = 512 * 1 - (z-1 * 0.25)
    - 2 = 384 = 1 - (3-1 * 0.25), 1 +(0.25)
    - 3 = 256 = 0.5
    - 4 = 128 = 0.25

    - 1 = 4
    - 2 = 3
    - 3 = 2
    - 4 = 1

    - 1.25 / 60 = 0.02083333
    - 1 / 48 = 0.02083333

    - 
    - 16, 32, 48, 64, 80
