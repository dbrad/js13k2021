## What do I need to make it 'playable' again

## Adventure generation 2.0 - Done?
- Stars are place according to the destinination and the stars on the way
- Stations are placed like... 350 - 400 units past stars
- 1-2 planets placed before and after star at 500 intervals within rand(80, 420) of that 500
- any dead space will be filled with asteroids and rogue planets
- sprinkle in ??? and pirates according to threat level of next star?
- enemies now need to move
  - zero engine will stop the player
  - mine and research need limits (4 per node probably 25,50,75,100%)
- Adventure rewards are no longer a thing
  - Contracts will have rewards
  - Contracts are turned in on the mission seleect screen

- Select a star, generate an adenture if the player clicks go
- update the adventure scene to

## Contracts
- pick a random system without a contract, favour lower status systems
- system will be marked with a ?
- make a contract and store in game state
  - contracts will be to bring raw mats, data, or to go to another specific system for a delivery
  - contracts will pay better rates than selling to store
  - combat contracts would be cool... but how to best handle it?
    - Cleaning up / bounty contracts
    - Defeat x pirates
  - do I want to use the 3 mat change?
- contract completion will level a system up one level

```ts
type Contract = {
  reward: number,
  type: number,
  materialsRequired?: number,
  dataRequired?: number,
  bountiesRequired?: number,
  bountiesCollected?: number,
  hasPackage?: boolean,
  destination?: number
}
```

## Threat levels
- all stars within the central area are low by default
- otherare are medium by default
- each time the player lands in a new system, 2 non-civilized systems become high threat
- will put a ! on them

## Mission Left Panel
- Selected system info
- name
- distance
- status
- threat level
- contract info area
 - either NONE label
 - or; the contract requirement
- depart button

## Mission Right Panel
- Current system name
- current system level: lawless, neutral, civilized
- develop system button (pay to level up system)
  - !Need a way to determine cost of this!
- active contract section
 - either NONE label
 - or; the contract requirement
 - and a turn-in button

 ## Ship select
 - if this is a new game, player will have 3 started ships
  - Old Research Vessel (Engine, Shield, Scanner)
  - Rusted Mining Vessel (Engine, Shield, M.Lasers)
  - Retired Combat Vessel (Engine, Shield, Weapons)
- coil players will have a 4th option
  - Abandon Imperial Cruiser (All 5 systems at level 1)

## Score tracking
- Keep track of each action the player takes that effects score
 - Mining
 - Data collected
 - System levels
 - Contracts completed
 - Hostiles neutralized

 ## End game, at level 5 generator
 - a 5th contract will be generated, the system will become high threat no matter way
 - if the player reaches the end, the station will be gone and replaced by the anomaly
 - maybe add an 'are you sure?'
 - once player enters the anomaly, game ends, score screen, store the score, wipe the save file, main menu
